Identified, left to right: Spr Dennis; Leading Seaman Clayton; 25630 Stoker John Francis Sevenoaks; S/6992 Sub Lieutenant Russell Frederick Smith (Second in Command); Able Seaman Aitken. Eight Z Special Unit commandos landed on Muschu Island on 11 April 1945, their mission being to capture a prisoner, reconnoitre the island's defences and locate two concealed naval guns, then rendezvous again with the launch. The men were NX82924 Lieutenant (Lt) Alan Robert Gubbay; VX6078 Lt Thomas Joseph Barnes; NX45386 Sergeant Malcolm Francis Max Weber; NX202843 Lance Corporal (L Cpl) Spencer Henry Walklate; NX73110 Sapper (Spr) Edgar Thomas 'Mick' Dennis; NX92651 Private (Pte) Ronald Edward Eagleton; VX66698 Pte Michael Hagger and WX27629 Pte John Richard Chandler. Their collapsible dinghies overturned while landing and all signal equipment and some weapons were lost. They continued on their mission which was all but complete when they took a wrong turn on their march back to their base and encountered an Japanese patrol. The commandos' prisoner slipped off his gag and shouted. The men escaped this enemy patrol, and later attempted unsuccessfully to put to sea on a raft, losing many more of their weapons in the process. Lt Gubbay, Lt Barnes, L Cpl Walklate and Pte Eagleton then put to sea on logs in an attempt to make contact with aircraft or patrol boats. They were never seen again. The remaining men remained on the island and by 14 April had approached bomb craters knowing they contained fresh water. They ran into a Japanese patrol and all except Spr Dennis were killed. Spr Dennis managed to escape further detection then swam 10 miles through shark infested waters to the mainland of New Guinea, pushing a heavy board on top of which he carried his Austen gun and ammunition. After beaching, he walked some 20 miles through enemy territory before being picked up by an Australian patrol near Aitape, approximately 10 days after the original landing. Spr Dennis was later awarded the Military Medal for his 'great courage and initiative'.", "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/AWM_P03953_004.jpg", "categories": ["Military history of Australia during World War II", "Images from the Australian War Memorial", "Battles of the Pacific War", "Z Special Unit", "PD-Australia", "Large images", "Black and white photographs of World War II"], "source": "This tag does not indicate the copyright status of the attached work.

It’s also a very apt description for the Elswick Works and Scotswood Works of Vickers Armstrong and its predecessor companies. These great factories, situated in Newcastle along the banks of the River Tyne, employed hundreds of thousands of men and women and built a huge variety of products for customers around the globe. The Elswick Works was established by William George Armstrong (later Lord Armstrong) in 1847 to manufacture hydraulic cranes. From these relatively humble beginnings the company diversified into many fields including shipbuilding, armaments and locomotives. By 1953 the Elswick Works covered 70 acres and extended over a mile along the River Tyne. This set of images, mostly taken from our Vickers Armstrong collection, includes fascinating views of the factories at Elswick and Scotswood, the products they produced and the people that worked there. By preserving these archives we can ensure that their legacy lives on. (Copyright) We're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons.
